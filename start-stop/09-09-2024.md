# Project Summary - LLM Powered Chatbot

## Date: 09-09-2024

### Overview
We are building an LLM powered chatbot using the Ollama model (llama3.1). The chatbot will connect to various databases to ingest information and respond to user queries.

### Databases Connected
- MySQL
- SQLite
- MariaDB
- MongoDB
- PostgreSQL

### Progress Today
1. **Project Initialization**: Started the project.
2. **CLI Implementation**: Developed a simple CLI for user interaction.
3. **Ollama Connection**: Connected the CLI to Ollama via local APIs.
4. **Environment Setup**: Created an `.env` file and set environment variables for Ollama and database credentials.

### Next Steps
1. Set up test databases.
2. Populate databases with test data.
3. Connect databases to the application.
4. Test LLM's handling of the data.
5. Consider developing a GUI, though CLI may suffice.

### Notes
- Future enhancements may include a more sophisticated GUI.
